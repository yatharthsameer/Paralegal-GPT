</p> 
<p data-structure="Issue" id="p_3">2. Present application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. has been filed for quashing the impugned summoning order dated 16.07.2018 passed by the learned Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division), Court No. 2, Judicial Magistrate, Muzaffar Nagar and impugned order dated 31.05.2023 passed by the Judicial Magistrate-II, Muzaffar Nagar as well as entire proceedings of Complaint Case No. 1975 of 2018 (Aniruddha vs. Lalit and Others), under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_2">sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_3">498A</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_4">506</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/751411/" id="a_5">Section 3</a>/<a href="/doc/1023340/" id="a_6">4</a> Dowry Prohibition Act, P.S.

</p> 
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_4">3. Contention of the counsel for the applicants is that the dispute between the parties is matrimonial in nature and in an application 482 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. No. 7335 of 2019, this matter was sent to Mediation Centre, High Court Allahabad. Both the parties have participated in mediation proceeding which culminated into the interim settlement dated 15.07.2019. Copy of the same has been annexed at page 35 of the paper book. As per the interim settlement, the parties agreed to live separately and also decided to move an application under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_8">section 13 (B)</a> of Hindu Marriage Act and apart from this, parties have also decided to withdraw the cases filed against each other. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="RespArg" id="p_5">4. This fact is not disputed by the counsel for the opposite party no. 2 and he also submitted that he got instructions from his client that if impugned proceeding is quashed then she will not have any objection. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_6">5. Considering the above fact that the dispute was purely matrimonial in nature and parties have amicably settled their dispute and interim settlement dated 15.07.2019 was also executed between the parties before the Mediation Centre, High Court Allahabad.

<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_7"><span class="citetext" data-sentiment="Pos" data-docid="69949024" id="span_1">6. Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/69949024/" id="a_9">Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab &amp; Another</a>; (2012) 10 SCC 303, in paragraph No. 61 of the judgement, observed as under:-</span> 
</p> 
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">"The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_10">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

</p> 

 
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">"15.1. the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to quash the criminal proceedings for the non-compoundable offences under Section 320 of the Code can be exercised having overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the parties have resolved the entire dispute amongst themselves;

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">15.3 similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences under the special statutes like the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_12">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5"><span class="citetext" data-sentiment="Neutral" data-docid="160278245" id="span_3">15.4.Offences under Section 307 IPC and the Arms Act, etc. would fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be treated as crime against the society and not against the individual alone, and therefore, the criminal proceedings for the offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_13">Section 307</a> IPC and/or the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_14">Arms Act</a>, etc. which have a serious impact on the society cannot be quashed in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code, on the ground that the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themselves. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_15">Section 307</a> IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_16">Section 307</a> IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to framing the charge under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_17">Section 307</a> IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delicate parts of the body, nature of weapons used, etc. However, such an exercise by the High Court would be permissible only after the evidence is collected after investigation and the charge-sheet is filed/charge is framed and/or during the trial. Such exercise is not permissible when the matter is still under investigation. Therefore, the ultimate conclusion in paras 29.6 and 29.7 of the decision of this Court <a href="/doc/160278245/" id="a_18">inNarinder Singh [Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (2014) 6 SCC 466 : (2014) 3 SCC (Cri) 54] should be read harmoniously and to be read as a whole and in the circumstances stated hereinabove;"</span>

<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_9">8. From above noted judgements, it is clear that merely mentioning the section of serious offences will not refrain the court from quashing the proceeding, if on considering the material on record, offences under that section is not made out.

<p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_10">9. Considering the material on record, this Court finds that no serious offence is made out against the applicants, which falls in the category of mental depravity or serious offences.
