</p> 
<p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_6">6. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that although the applicant is the husband of the informant but he has been falsely implicated in the present case. It is argued that the version of the first information report is a concocted version in as much as the police after investigation has submitted a final report in favour of Kavita (nand), Babita (nand) and Rohit friend of the applicant. It is submitted that in the present matter four persons including the informant namely Smt. Anjali, Ram Kishan father of the informant, Ankit &amp; Ashish brothers of the informant received injuries whereas Rameshwar the uncle of the informant is the deceased. It is submitted that after the death of Rameshwar <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_16">section 304</a> I.P.C. was added in the matter. It is submitted that the deceased Rameshwar was found to have received a single injury which as per the postmortem report was described as hematoma on the inner aspect of left thigh with facture on left femur. The cause of death was opined as septicemic shock due to the mentioned injury. It is submitted that the present case has a cross version also of which a first information report was lodged as Case Crime No.242 of 2022, under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_17">Sections 147</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_18">323</a>, <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_19">504</a>, <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_20">452</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_21">506</a> I.P.C. against the family members of the informant in which the applicant along with Devendra Khari (brother of the applicant), Rajendra Singh (father of the applicant) and Smt.

It is further argued that general and omnibus allegations have been levelled against the applicant and all the accused persons. The author of the injury to the deceased is not known. The applicant has no criminal history as stated in para 20 of the affidavit and is in jail since 16.07.2022. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="RespArg" id="p_7"><span class="citetext" data-sentiment="PARTY" data-docid="1935531" id="span_1">7. Per contra, learned counsel for the first informant vehemently opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that that bail of co-accused Devendra Khari has been rejected by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 19.11.2022 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 52070 of 2022 (<a href="/doc/1935531/" id="a_22">Devendra Khari vs. State of U.P.</a>), the copy of the order has been produced before the Court which is taken on record.

It is submitted that looking to the facts and the active involvement of the applicant, the bail application be rejected.</span>

</p> 
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_9">9. After having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it is evident that although co-accused Devendra Khari has been denied bail by another Bench of this Court vide order dated 19.11.2022 but reading of the said order goes to show that the Court in the order states that none of the members of the applicant side sustained any injury whereas the fact of the matter which is not disputed is that three persons from the side of the applicant have received injuries and were medically examined. General and omnibus allegations have been levelled against the applicant and all the accused persons. The author of the injury of the deceased is not known. There is a cross version of the incident in which also charge-sheet has been submitted. The fact as to who is the aggressor cannot be decided at this stage.
