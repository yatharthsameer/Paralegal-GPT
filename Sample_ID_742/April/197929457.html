</pre><p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_1">Heard Shri Mohd. Afzal, learned counsel for the applicant, Shri Madhvendra Pratap Singh learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the material on record.
</p> 
<p data-structure="Issue" id="p_2">The present bail application has been filed on behalf of applicant Archana under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with a prayer to release her on bail in Case Crime No. 273 of 2023 for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">Section 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_3">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_4">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_5">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_6">323</a>, <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_7">504</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_8">506</a>, <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_9">452</a> of the Indian Penal Code, registered at Police Station Kasganj, District Kasganj, during pendency of the trial, after rejecting the bail application of the applicant by Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 4, Kasganj vide order dated 23.2.2024.
</p> 
<p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_3">Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. It is further submitted that the first information report dated 21.4.2023 has been lodged by the father-in-law of the present applicant against the applicant and two other named persons on the basis of an application under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_10">Section 156(3)</a>, Cr.P.C. alleging that the applicant got recorded her name and her daughter's name in the revenue record after death of her husband.
</p> 
<p data-structure="Facts" id="p_4">It is further submitted that wife of the first informant (third wife) is accused in a case under <a href="/doc/1374258/" id="a_11">Section 364-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_12">120-B</a>, IPC and the dead body of the husband of the present applicant was recovered on the instance of wife of the first informant. It is further submitted that the name of her husband was already recorded in the revenue record and there is no evidence to prepare the false and forged death certificate.
</p> 
<p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_5">He has next argued that the applicant is languishing in jail since 6.2.2024, having no criminal history nor there is any likelihood of fleeing from course of justice or tempering with evidence in case of released on bail. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="RespArg" id="p_6">Per contra, learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail of the applicant by contending that the innocence of the applicant cannot be adjudged at pre trial stage, therefore, she does not deserve any indulgence. In case the applicant is released on bail, she will again indulge in similar activities and will misuse the liberty of bail. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_7"><span class="citetext" data-sentiment="Pos" data-docid="155274324" id="span_1"><span class="citetext" data-sentiment="Pos" data-docid="656741" id="span_2"><span class="citetext" data-sentiment="Pos" data-docid="8258" id="span_3">In <a href="/doc/8258/" id="a_13">State of Rajasthan Vs. Balchand @ Baliay</a> (1977) 4 SCC 308, the Apex Court observed that bail is the rule and committal to jail is an exception and refusal of bail is a restriction on the personal liberty of the individual guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, which is reiterated in <a href="/doc/656741/" id="a_15">Gudikanti Narasimhulu And Ors Vs. Public Prosecutor, High</a> Court Of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1978 SC 429 and further reiterated in <a href="/doc/155274324/" id="a_16">Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation &amp; Another</a>, (2021) 10 SCC 773.</span></span></span>
</p> 
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_8">Keeping in mind, larger mandate of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_17">Article 21</a> of the constitution of India, the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of punishment which conviction will entail, the character of the accused-applicant, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interest of the public/ State and other circumstances, but without expressing any opinion on the merits, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_9">Let the applicant Archana be released on bail in the aforesaid case crime number on her furnishing a personal bond and two reliable sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to the following conditions :-

<p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_10">In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. If in the opinion of the trial court that absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed in accordance with law.
</p> 
<p data-structure="Conclusion" id="p_11">The trial court may make all possible efforts/endeavour and try to conclude the trial expeditiously in accordance with law after the release of the applicant, if there is no other legal impediment.
