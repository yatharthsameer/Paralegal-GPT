</p> 
<p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_3">Learned Counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. It is further submitted that the first information report dated 10.1.2023 has been lodged against the applicant and five other named persons alleging that one Sonu Kumar by impersonating co-accused Lav Kush Patel executed a sale deed in favour of the first informant on 5.12.2022 for a total sale consideration of Rs. 70,00,000/-. Out of Rs. 70,00,000/-, Rs. 20,00,000/- has been transferred by the first informant in the account of co-accused Lav Kush Patel and Rs. 50,00,000/- has been paid in cash to other five accused persons.
</p> 
<p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_4">It is further submitted that as per prosecution case, role of mediator has been assigned to the present applicant. It is further submitted that in the first information report/statement of the first informant, it has not been mentioned as to on which date first informant has paid the cash amount to the present applicant. It is further submitted that co-accused Shankar Ji, who also received Rs. 10,00,000/- as per prosecution case, has been granted Anticipatory Bail by the Sessions Judge, Ballia.
</p> 
<p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_5">He has next argued that applicant has criminal history of one case related to offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_10">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_11">504</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_12">506</a>, IPC and <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_13">Section 3(1)(d)</a> of SC/ST Act. After lodging of the first information report, another case of cheating has been lodged against the applicant on 29.6.2023. The applicant is languishing in jail since 11.10.2023. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_6"><span class="citetext" data-sentiment="PARTY" data-docid="114457030" id="span_1">Learned counsel for the applicant has relied upon the judgments of Apex Court in <a href="/doc/114457030/" id="a_14">Ash Mohammad Vs. Shiv Raj Singh @ Lalla Babu and another</a>, (2012) 9 SCC 446 and Prabhakar Tiwari Vs. State of U.P. and another, (2020) 11 SCC 648 wherein the Apex Court has observed that pendency of other criminal cases against the accused may itself cannot be a basis for refusal of bail.</span> 
</p> 
<p data-structure="RespArg" id="p_7">Per contra, learned A.G.A. as well as learned counsel for the first informant have vehemently opposed the prayer for bail of the applicant by contending that cancellation of Anticipatory Bail has been moved before this Bench and the innocence of the applicant cannot be adjudged at pre trial stage, therefore, he does not deserve any indulgence. In case the applicant is released on bail, he will again indulge in similar activities and will misuse the liberty of bail.

Central Bureau of Investigation &amp; Another</a>, (2021) 10 SCC 773].</span></span></span>
</p> 
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_9">No material or circumstances has been brought to the notice of this Court with regard to tampering of evidence or intimidating of witnesses in previous criminal history. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_10">Keeping in mind, larger mandate of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Article 21</a> of the constitution of India, the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of punishment which conviction will entail, the character of the accused-applicant, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interest of the public/ State and other circumstances, but without expressing any opinion on the merits, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. 
</p> 
<p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_11">Let applicant, Ashish Kumar Patel @ Bajrangi be released on bail in the aforesaid case crime number on his furnishing a personal bond and two reliable sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to the following conditions:
